# Year-Periodization-Calculator-2021-
A simple python program for determining specified group of years possible 

Note: I recommend that you open this script in a separate cmd window. This because it will be stay permanently until you close the command prompt! 

And for the Portable Version not to be used in Linux OS! (since only years 1-9999 valid only), anyway you can use your smartphones to run the portable version instead!

--> A program to calculate whether the start, the current, also the end of any year cycles.


Features 18 modes (extensions included) you can explore, with total of astronomical year numbering convention infested! (as same as commonly used demarcations/conventions today), and with a guide for sure. Also includes an infinite-bound calendar maker for you!

Note: I recommend for all of you to use the most updated version of Python to run this code/program. And also I apologize if there is one or more outputs or mistypes that not aligned clearly, or too much lines of code used to construct this program! 

Hopefully useful, hidden things awaits!

Thank you!
